## About

Laravel Translate provides instant free translations using Google, AWS, Bing or any other translation service. It also allows translations to be set in language files and the database to provide a truly flexible translation tool.

- Translate any text instantly using a multitude of translation services, without tying yourself to a specific service.
- Commit specific translations to version control.
- Use the frontend to specify translation overrides.
- Easily extensible.
- Fully tested.

## Installation

All you need to do to use this project is pull it into an existing Laravel app using composer.

```shell script
composer require twigger/laravel-translate
```

You can publish the configuration file by running 
```shell script
php artisan vendor:publish --provider=\Twigger\Translate\TranslationServiceProvider
```

## Basic Usage

Laravel Translate can be used with no configuration. To ensure this package can be used for any project, we provide multiple entry points including a Facade and an API. 

### Using the Facade

The easiest way to translate any text is to use the ```Translate``` facade. The following line will translate 'A string to translate' from English to French.

```php
$frenchString = \Twigger\Translate\Translate::translate('A string to translate', 'fr', 'en');
```

The translate function takes the string to translate as the first argument, the language to translate to (the target language) as the second argument and the source language as the third.

There is an alternative function called ```translateMany```, which takes an array of strings rather than a single string. This is useful for efficiently translating multiple strings at the same time.

```php
$frenchStrings = \Twigger\Translate\Translate::translateMany(['A string to translate', 'A second string to translate'], 'fr', 'en');
```

#### Target Language

The target language will depend on your end user. They may have the language set in their browser, your app may give them language options, or you may wish to use the default Laravel locale.

To simplify the detection of this language, the Laravel Translate package provides a detection facade.

```php
$targetLocale = \Twigger\Translate\Detect::lang();
```

The strategies used to detect the requested locale can be modified, which is described further in the [configuration](#configuration) section.

#### Source Language

The source language is required, as many websites may have content written in multiple languages. If this is not the case, we recommend passing in the Laravel locale as a sensible default.

```php
\Twigger\Translate\Translate::translate('A string to translate', 'fr', \Illuminate\Support\Facades\App::getLocale());
```

You may then edit the ```locale``` key in your ```config/app.php``` file to define the default locale.

### Using the API

The Laravel Translate package provides an API for translating any text. The endpoint is defined in the configuration file, but defaults to ```_translate```. The source and target language are automatically detected as described above.

#### Translating single lines

##### Request

```http request
POST /_translate HTTP/1.1
Accept: application/json
Content-Type: application/json
{
    "line": "A line to translate"
}
```

##### Response

```http request
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
{
   "translation": "The translated line in the detected language"
}
```

#### Translating multiple lines

##### Request

```http request
POST /_translate HTTP/1.1
Accept: application/json
Content-Type: application/json
{
    "lines": [
        "A line to translate",
        "Another line to translate",
    ]
}
```

##### Response

```http request
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
{
   "translations": [
        "The translated line in the detected language",
        "The second translated line in the detected language",
    ]
}
```

#### Overriding the source and target language

This will translate the line from english to french. Although ```target_lang``` and ```source_lang``` are not required, either or both may be given to override the default behaviour of the API.
##### Request

```http request
POST /_translate HTTP/1.1
Accept: application/json
Content-Type: application/json
{
    "line": "A line to translate",
    "target_lang": "fr",
    "source_lang": "en"
}
```

##### Response

```http request
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
{
   "translation": "The translated line in the detected language"
}
```

### Using the js translator

Currently under development.

Using our javascript tool, you can easily translate any text from Vue, React or just plain javascript. It helps maintain a balance between time taken to translate text and the number of API calls, by collecting translation requests and translating many in one.

### Using Blade

Currently under development

If you use the blade templating engine to define your frontend, you can make use of our blade directive to quickly translate any text.

### Using the helper function

Rather than relying on the facade, you can easily use our helper function which uses the facade in the background.

### Overriding translations

TODO Using the DB to override translations. Need to do frontend.

## Configuration

### Package configuration

- Setting up the package (service provider)
- Config options

### Registering a new configuration

- Config options defined in config.
- Defining more config directly through manager

## Extending

- What's the difference? THe buck stops with the handler - should be able to translate anything.
- Writing & registering a handler.
- Writing & registering an interceptor.
